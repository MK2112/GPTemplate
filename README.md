# GPTemplate
A minimal template for training and using a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model in PyTorch.<br>
Think of this as a small starter kit for your next NLP project. All you need to provide is a text file.<br>
The model will be trained on this text, line by line, and will output text just like this.
